# Neural Document Classification

Document image classification with neural networks on a subset of the RVL-CDIP dataset [[1]](#1).

## Getting Started
The classification problem is tackled with two different approaches:
* Visual approach over the image pixels with dense only and convolutional neural networks: ```skeleton.ipynb```
* Textual approach over the recognized image words with bag-of-words and word embedding models: ```skeleton_ocr.ipynb```

It is recommended to begin with the visual approach as it includes more details about the computing environment setup and the dataset.

For a better experience, execute the notebooks within a Google Colab environment.
